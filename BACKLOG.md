# Backlog

Small things worth doing that are deliberately not being done now, so that deferring them stays a
decision rather than an omission. Each entry says what, where, and why it was left.

## Open findings

**The harness models one precondition where there are two.**
Found during A7-5 on 2026-09-05, in the window between `cleanup.sh` and the first `start.sh`. Four
cases fail there that `--no-system` does not skip: A3-3 twice (`known_hosts` seeded), A4-16 (the
shared hook present and executable) and A1-4 (the live workspace). None of them needs the containers
running; all of them need **the start script to have run at least once**, because they assert its
output. `stackGuard` covers "containers are up" and nothing covers "the start has produced its
files", so `--no-system` promises a suite that runs without the stack and does not deliver one.

The cost is not only the broken promise. On a machine that has never started, these fail with
`expected true, received false`, while the system cases fail with *"stack not running … Start the
stack with ./scripts/linux/start.sh"* — the same difference between a refusal that names the next
step and one that does not, which FR20 exists to remove. A second guard asserting the start's
artefacts, with that message, would fix both halves.

Deferred rather than fixed because it is harness work discovered mid-procedure, and A7-5's own record
should carry it once the case completes.

**One unreproduced intermittent failure in the full suite.**
Recorded in the amendment to A5-3's detail block. The M-A5 fixture failed to build once during the
operator's second verification run and has not reproduced since — four consecutive runs, the
aside-and-restore sequence repeated by hand, and the setup executed by hand in the container were all
green. No cause is claimed. Two changes narrowed its surface: the probe directory is now unique per
run, and the setup's output is asserted before its exit code, so the next occurrence will say what
git said instead of only `received: 1`.

**The proof of passage is per clone, not per publication.**
Found by A7-4 on 2026-09-04, and recorded rather than fixed. `git-publish` writes
`.git/liquidupstart-publish` immediately before pushing and removes it afterwards whether or not the
push was accepted, and the hook consumes whatever it finds there. With two publications in flight in
one clone, the permission one mints can therefore be consumed by the other's hook or removed by the
other's cleanup. It **fails closed** — the loser is refused in the hook's words and nothing reaches
the remote, which is what FR18 asks for — so this is not a defect; but which of two well-behaved
publications succeeds is decided by timing. A per-invocation permission (a token naming the process,
or the ref and sha it was minted for, checked by the hook) would remove the interaction. It is
deferred because it changes the mechanism M-A6 signed off, and no requirement asks for it.

**The `git config` error in the A5-9 transcript is inferred, not observed.**
OpenClaw showed `Bash failed: run git config` and the exact argument list is not in the screenshots.
The reading — a `git config --get` on an unset key, which exits 1 — follows from the clone carrying
no local `user.name` or `user.email` and the identity coming from the environment. Expanding the
`Tool error Bash` row in OpenClaw would confirm or refute it. Low value, recorded so the inference is
not later read as an observation.
